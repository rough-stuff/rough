<b>Rough.js</b> is a light weight, stand-alone [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) based library that lets you draw in a _sketchy_, _hand-drawn-like_, style.
The library defines primitives to draw lines, curves, arcs, polygons, circles, and ellipses. It also supports drawing [SVG paths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths).

## Credits

This project was inspired by [Handy](http://www.gicentre.net/handy/), a java based library for [Processing](https://processing.org/).
Rough.js borrows some core algorithms from Handy, but it is _not a JS port_ for processing.js.
